Synopsis: 
Art Stage Singapore| the flagship art fair of Southeast Asia| kicks off the international art season every January with the very best of Asian contemporary art. It bookmarks Singapore on the map as the definitive meeting point between the diverse regional and global art scenes. The Fair is a catalyst in driving international interest in and understanding of Southeast Asian contemporary art.  
With a strong network of galleries| collectors| artists| and industry professionals| Art Stage Singapore plays a pivotal role in unifying the various art markets in the region to forge a collective and singular Southeast Asian art market. The Fair also acts as a forum for discourse and debate| engaging audiences with a deeper understanding of pertinent issues in Southeast Asia. Launched in 2015| the Joseph Balestier Award for the Freedom of Art| jointly presented by Art Stage Singapore and the Embassy of United States in Singapore| honours an artist or curator from the region whose work continuously seeks to express the ideals of freedom and liberty.   
Beyond the Fair in January| Art Stage Singapore also collaborates with local and regional art galleries and communities to organise exciting contemporary art events throughout the year. Since its inaugural edition in 2011| Art Stage Singapore has galvanized the arts scene in Singapore| leading to the creation of Singapore Art Week - an initiative led by the National Arts Council| in partnership with the Singapore Tourism Board and Economic Development Board of Singapore.",10% off tickets,Not available,None,Postal Codes,Not available,Not available,https://www.ocbc.com/assets/images/Cards_Promotions_Visuals/art-stage-small.jpg,Not available,Not Available,2016-01-24T23:59:59Z,2668,220_2668,Art Stage Singapore,Not available,Not available,All,"•Offers are not valid with other promotions| offers or privileges.
