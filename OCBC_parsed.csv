Synopsis 
Master of  the house| Orgon| has invited religious Tartuffe to stay with the family. Not  only that| his admiration for him is near insanity. He wants his daughter to  marry Tartuffe| before making him the sole heir to his wealth. The rest of the  family - the wife| son| daughter| and even the maid - has seen the hypocrite  behind Tartuffe’s pious appearance| except for Orgon who remains blinded by  faith. As such| the family finds themselves at wit’s end. How do you make a fox  reveals its true nature? How do you make someone see the truth? 
Following  An Enemy of the People| Nine Years Theatre brings to you in 2015 the second  production under “NYT Ensemble Project”. Tartuffe| by French playwright  Moli┼áre| is a classic comedy with a theme that proves relevant even to the  modern world. NYT sincerely presents another new take on world classics.
