The name is a portmanteau of art and tea, where adjacent to the premium tea lounge is an art jam studio. The whole concept of social interaction through the expression of painting and gathering whilst overlooking the busy life of orchard road from above is truly an exquisite experience. 
 Upon entering the caf , dinners and social gatherers are presented with a sneak peak of the menu written on the board above the semi open kitchen.The theme of the dishes is breakfast and the cuisine is world cuisine. The eclecticism is a result from three different chefs who have been traveling around the world garnering some of the best of secret recipes. The presentation of the food reflects the rustic and home styled comfort foods that they are, moving away from the pretentious fine dining to keep our diners comfortable and feeling at home. Arteastiq is a tea house after all and a house should be filled with friends, family and laughter.

 Operating Hours: Monday - Friday: 11am - 10pm Saturday - Sunday: 9am - 10pm "," Nestled In the heart of Orchard Road where the hustle and bustle of city life is fast and frantic, Arteastiq, a boutique tea house, offers an oasis of a venue. The name is a portmanteau of art and tea, where adjacent to the premium tea lounge is an art jam studio. The whole concept of social interaction through the expression of painting and gathering whilst overlooking the busy life of orchard road from above is truly an exquisite experience. 
 Upon entering the caf , dinners and social gatherers are presented with a sneak peak of the menu written on the board above the semi open kitchen.The theme of the dishes is breakfast and the cuisine is world cuisine. The eclecticism is a result from three different chefs who have been traveling around the world garnering some of the best of secret recipes. The presentation of the food reflects the rustic and home styled comfort foods that they are, moving away from the pretentious fine dining to keep our diners comfortable and feeling at home. Arteastiq is a tea house after all and a house should be filled with friends, family and laughter.
